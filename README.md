# Web-Development-Neu
Web development at Northeastern

This repository stores my work at Northeastern mostly during the web development course work.

This project is a museum webiste which implements google maps API, slideshow of artifacts of the museum that comes from a REST API
and also has a shopping cart implementation that emulates a real time website.
