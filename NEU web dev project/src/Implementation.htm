  <div class="panel-body">
  Layouts are one of the most key aspects for a website and hence I have used the best layout designs for my projects.<br />
  I have used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/" >BOOTSTRAP </a> throughout my project for each and every page.
  Benefits of using Bootstrap: <br />
  Designs the website to perfection and also very easy to make the website tablet and moblie friendly by adding very minimal javascripts and jQuery.
  <br />
  Requires writing very little code where the bootstrap CSS and javasrcript does all the layout work to perfection.

  <div class="panel-heading">API Handling</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
  Thanks to the Brooklyn museum I was able to find an awesome API best suited for this project: <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/">BROOKLYN MUSEUM API</a><br />
  I had to make use of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/">YQL</a> which helps in processing the type of different API responses into the format desired by us which can be used for further processing
  The API response is a JSON response which is in the form of JSON objects and arrays which need to be handled in the right way to make use of them <br />
  For the maps page in the website I have made use of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/"> Google Maps API</a> which is a wonderful API to explore and implement<br />
  Using the Google maps API helps users who have trouble locating the museum to find the museum with ease and also help users to plan their visit

  <div class="panel-heading">Login module</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
  I have implemented the Login module using the ASP .net login feature<br />
  After successfully connecting to the Database and creating the user login table I have created users who can login with their credentials and leave their valuable comments
  <br />
  Upon leaving the comments the comments of the users will be stored in an XML flat file usnig the XML write features: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zx8h06sz(v=vs.110).aspx">MSDN</a>
  <br />
  Once the user is done providing the comments he can log off
